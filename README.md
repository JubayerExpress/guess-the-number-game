# Guess the Number Game

This is a web-based "Guess the Number" game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player needs to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. It also tracks the number of attempts and offers a visually appealing, responsive design.

## Project Overview

The game includes:
- An `index.html` file that structures the main webpage.
- A `styles.css` file for modern and interactive styling.
- A `script.js` file that contains the game logic and handles user input.

## Features

- **Random Number Generation**: Generates a random number between 1 and 100 at the start of the game.
- **Interactive User Input**: Players input their guess, and the game responds dynamically with helpful feedback (too high, too low, or correct).
- **Attempts Tracking**: The number of attempts is displayed and updated after each guess.
- **Winning and Losing Feedback**: The game provides clear visual feedback when the player wins (green success message) or loses (red failure message).
- **Restart Option**: After the game ends (either by guessing correctly or running out of attempts), players can restart the game with a click of a button.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is optimized for various screen sizes and works well on both desktop and mobile devices. The input field, buttons, and layout adjust seamlessly to ensure a smooth user experience.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Subtle animations and hover effects improve the interactivity of the game, providing a more engaging experience.
